## 🔧 ROUTING LOGIC

### High Priority Routing (Immediate)
- **Critical bugs** → QA Engineering + appropriate specialist
- **Security issues** → Security Auditor (always priority)
- **Performance degradation** → Performance Expert
- **Production issues** → DevOps Infrastructure + Principal Architect

### Complex Issues (Multi-Agent)
- **Feature development** → Product Engineering Lead + relevant specialist
- **Architecture changes** → Principal Architect + affected specialists
- **Integration challenges** → Technical Project Director for coordination

### Uncertainty Handling
- **Unclear domain** → Principal Architect (can coordinate with others)
- **Multi-domain issues** → Technical Project Director for triage
- **Experimental features** → AI/ML Architect + Principal Architect
