# ðŸ¤– BookLocal AI Agent System Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### 1. Automatic Routing
Every query is automatically analyzed and routed to the best specialist agent:

```
Your Query â†’ Master Coordinator â†’ Specialist Agent â†’ Expert Solution
```

### 2. Context Injection  
All agents automatically receive:
- Complete BookLocal project architecture
- Current implementation status (Phase 3 complete)
- Technical stack and performance targets
- Recent features and current priorities

### 3. Specialist Expertise
Each agent has deep domain knowledge:
- **Frontend Architect**: React 19, Next.js 15, Three.js, animations
- **Backend Architect**: Supabase, APIs, databases, authentication  
- **AI/ML Architect**: OpenAI, embeddings, semantic search, recommendations
- **Security Auditor**: OWASP compliance, threat modeling, zero-trust
- **Performance Expert**: Core Web Vitals, optimization, bundle analysis
- **DevOps Infrastructure**: Deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, scaling
- **QA Engineering**: Testing automation, quality assurance
- **Product Engineering Lead**: UX optimization, conversion analysis
- **Technical Project Director**: Coordination, planning, delivery

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### Frontend Issue
```
"The 3D room component is laggy on mobile devices"
â†’ Routes to Frontend Architect
â†’ Gets Three.js optimization recommendations
```

### Backend Problem  
```
"API responses are slow, need database optimization"
â†’ Routes to Backend Architect  
â†’ Gets PostgreSQL query optimization and indexing strategies
```

### AI Feature Request
```
"Want to improve the semantic search accuracy"
â†’ Routes to AI/ML Architect
â†’ Gets embedding optimization and model tuning advice
```

### Security Concern
```
"Need to review authentication flow for vulnerabilities"  
â†’ Routes to Security Auditor
â†’ Gets OWASP compliance audit and recommendations
```

1. Install GitHub Copilot Chat extension
2. Agent files are in `.github/chatmodes/`
3. Master Coordinator is set as default router

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set for full functionality:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

The agent system is designed to:
- Route 95%+ of queries to the correct specialist
- Provide complete BookLocal context automatically
