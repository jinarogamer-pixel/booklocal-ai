3. **Prove the concept** - Does the UX work?
4. **Start fundraising** - Show traction to investors

## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your values (most can be left as placeholders for MVP)
nano .env.local
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` - you should see the landing page.

### 4. Test the Forms
- **Customer booking**: `http://localhost:3000/book`
- **Contractor signup**: `http://localhost:3000/contractor-signup`

Both forms will log data to the console (check your terminal).

## üöÄ Deploy to Production

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Deployment
