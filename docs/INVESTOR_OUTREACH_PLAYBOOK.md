# Investor Outreach Playbook

Narrative (Wedge)
- Cinematic 3D previews + AI matching + transparent trust scoring → higher conversion, lower CAC in local services.
- Supply moat via provider credibility + content; defensibility via data network effects and workflows.

Raise Targets
- Amount: choose based on budget model (Scrappy $0.8–1.0M; Focused $2.0–2.5M; Aggressive $4–5M)
- Use of funds: Team 70%, GTM 20%, Infra 7%, Legal/Ops 3%
- 18‑month milestones: MAU 10k+, GMV $250k+/mo, 300+ active providers, CAC <$120, LTV/CAC >3x

Assets Required
- 12–15 slide deck, 90s product video, KPI dashboard, technical memo (AI/3D), security summary, data room (financial model, hiring plan, GTM plan, contracts)

Targets
- Proptech/marketplace VCs, AI infra funds, operator angels in home services/marketplaces.
- Build a 60–100 target list with tiers (A/B/C) and warm intros first.

Sequence & Cadence
- Week 1–2: 10–15 warm intros; Week 3–4: 20–30 targeted; Bi‑weekly updates with product/GTM progress.
