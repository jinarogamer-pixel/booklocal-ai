# Seed Deck + 90‑Second Product Video Brief

Deck (12–15 slides)
- Use `docs/DECK_OUTLINE.md` as backbone; add FL market focus, early metrics, provider logos/testimonials.

90‑Second Video
- Goal: Show the cinematic 3D + AI matching + trust meter driving confidence.
- Structure (approx):
  0–10s: Problem — “Hiring pros is risky and opaque.”
  10–35s: Solution — 3D room viewer with material swaps; AI match picks
  35–55s: Trust — transparent scoring; credentials; reviews
  55–75s: Flow — post project → matched providers → chat → booking
  75–90s: Social proof, partner logos, CTA
- Capture: Loom/Screenflow 1440p; product screen captures; animated overlays.
- Cinematic b‑roll options: Runway Gen‑3 Alpha, Pika, or After Effects templates; optionally experiment with Google Veo 2 when accessible.
- Specs: 1920×1080, 24/30fps, h.264; 9:16 cuts for shorts; subtitle .srt.
